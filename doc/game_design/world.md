# World

The world is the environment in which the game is played.
This game is a side-scrolling action RPG, so the world is
2D. The world is made up of separate maps that are connected via
exits on the sides, or through entrances such as doors/cave mouths etc.

## Features

### Obelisk
Obelisks are save points. When Luna interacts with an obelisk, her health and mana are restored to full and a prompt
whether to save the game is shown. If the player chooses to save, the game is saved and Luna may respawn at the obelisk
when she dies.
