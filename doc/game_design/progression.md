# Progression

The game will be non-linear in the sense that the player can go anywhere that they choose to,
but may not be able to get very far in some areas without the proper equipment, skills, or level. The
story will be explained to the player in the form of major quests, the completion of which will
unlock new areas of the map and new quests. The player will also be able to complete side quests
to gain experience and items.

## Story Quests

### The Banishment [Introductory Quest]
Luna is framed for treason and banished from the kingdom by her father, the king. She is sent to the dungeon prison
to await her fate. She must escape the dungeon and find her way out of the kingdom. This quest will introduce the player
to the basic mechanics of the game.

Luna escapes into the thick forest surrounding the kingdom and must find her way to the nearest town, where she can
find supplies and information on how to clear her name.
