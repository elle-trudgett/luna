# Luna
Luna is the titular character of the game. She is a young, down-to-earth
woman and a skilled swordswoman and sorcerer. Officially, she is the Princess
of Entarya, however, she
was banished from her kingdom by her father, the king, leaving
her to fend for herself and find her own way in the world, and hopefully
prove herself and make her way back into the kingdom.

## Mechanics

Luna can equip both physical and magical weapons. She switches
between the two depending on the type of skill she uses.
To start, she only knows non-elemental magic, but she can
learn elemental magic as she progresses through the game.

## Experience and Levels

## Skills

Luna learns skills through the allocation of skill points, which
she earns through leveling up. She allocates these points into
skill trees, which are divided into physical and magical skills.
The trees are separate and can be developed independently, but a
skill point can only be put into one of the two trees.

By default, a basic sword attack is learned at level 1 and bound to the
Square button. This attack is a simple sword slash. Circle is used
to dash, and Triangle is used to cast a spell. Cross is jump.
